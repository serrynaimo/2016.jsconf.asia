            <h4>Chengxi Li, Tencent</h4>
            <p>
                Nowadays, live streaming is an essential feature of an internet product. There are tons of examples that show when live streaming can enrich a product: Super-stars connecting with fans, professors broadcasting vivid live courses and live video shopping experiences. <br/>
                In this talk, I‚Äòm going to use React, a component based framework which makes it easy to build and maintain the bricks and blocks for a live streaming web-app. He'll dive into performance optimizations and how you can migrate your product to offer similar functionality and keep up with this trend.

            <h3>Automate Your Electronic Life With The JS Ecosystem</h3>
            <h4>Vito Chin <a href="https://twitter.com/vitoc" target="_blank">@vitoc</a></h4>
            <p>
                Bots and machine learning are all the rave these days. But does it feel like we‚Äôre being force-fed pre-packaged AI that we do not have much autonomy over? The greatest potential in leveraging computer-based automation for the individual should be one that we can teach to serve the need of its personal owner. Sometimes, we may need robots that drives for us less than an automated process that helps us with the increasing chores that we do online, repetitively and sometimes seemingly futile. For example, how many times had you wondered if the computer can just download the CSV of your bank statement for you (in the absence of proper APIs), process it and augment it to your ledger automatically? Or the times where you wish there could be an easier way to tell the computer to do something on bash than to issue a command with 5 parameters? Javascript has all the answer for you, with tools such as Nightmare.JS to automate browser-based activities, CLI frameworks such as Vorpal and of course the biggest collection of packages in the world that is npm. The trick to continuous harmony is to find something that can gel all of these cool Javascript tech together and run itself as a continuous concern, essentially becoming a simpler computer-based version of yourself, augmented. In this quick talk, I will share my little adventure and experiment trying to automate the boring bits of my electronic life with such a JavaScript tool called Jodot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vito had been looking for that special something that can maximise his code and family time for quite some number of years. Recently, he believe he might just had found it within the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and npm. That aside, he‚Äôs into cloud and software development stuffs. He co-authored PHP Development in the Cloud and maintains Gmagick (pecl.php.net/gmagick)

            <h3>Run Your JS App For Years On A Coin Cell</h3>
            <h4>Jan Jongboom, ARM <a href="https://twitter.com/janjongboom" target="_blank">@janjongboom</a></h4>
            <p>
              In the past years we have seen a number of initiatives to bring JavaScript to Internet of Things devices. The idea seems great: one language for both device, server and the web application. But IoT devices are a different beast... They have to run for years on a battery, have rock-solid security and networking stacks built in, and there needs to be a story to go from development board to production. We have seen various approaches: from running node.js on an embedded Linux box, to cross-compiling JavaScript to Lua to machine code, to ripping out motherboards out of phones. None of them with much success.<br/>
              If we want JavaScript on IoT devices we need to start thinking small. IoT devices generally run on microcontrollers. Tiny computers, with processing power measured in MHz and RAM measured in kilobytes. What they lack in processing power, they make up in power consumption - they can easily run for years on a coin cell - and in peripherals, some chips have over a hundred Input/Output ports to connect sensors, actuators and radios. And from there, we need to look at a library ecosystem that is already proven on microcontrollers... Well-tested middleware, that has both security and battery consumption as top priorities. <br/>
              In this presentation I‚Äòll talk about microcontrollers, JavaScript, and tiny beacons; and will probably play with lasers through JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jan keeps following JSConf.Asia around. And we're glad he does! He is now working as Developer Evangelist IoT for ARM, and is always on the lookout on how to connect the web with the real world.<br/>
              He loves doing unexpected stuff with sensors, flying drones from the browser, and breaking phones.<br/>
              Before ARM he was a core contributor to Firefox OS, and he wrote hundreds of patches to various open source projects.<br/>He's also a Google Developer Expert for Web technologies.

            <p>
              Remember the times when you needed to hardcode an API response because the actual APIs are still to be implemented? Making it impossible to simulate edge cases with the real APIs or the network?
              The wait is over! Khang has created just the tool for those situations.

              Stack Overflow is a website that helps millions of developers every day. On the other hand, not many developers realize that this site serves them with incredible efficiency. For example, a question and answer page is typically served in 10ms.<br/>
              How do you serve so many requests in so little time while running on 9 web servers? In this new talk, I will explain how this is planned, implemented and measured.

                  Run your JS code on the GPU! This project is the result of a fun hackathon story of achieving the impossible in 24 hours.
                  YMMV for your actual performance profit through parallelization.

                <p>
                  As a GPU computing and JavaScript enthusiast, Fazli envisioned an easy way to perform GPU inside the browser. Thus, working with a few fellow engineers, gpu.js was created as an online platform that could be used to teach parallel computing concepts to beginners. He is presently working as a software engineer at Garena, and enjoys hacking random stuff together in his free time.<br/><br/>
                  In his free time, Eugene is constantly tinkering around with technology. From GPU.JS coding, reading up HTML5 specifications, experimenting with his own programming language, etc. For fun. In his work time, he runs his own website and mobile applications development company Picoded Pte Ltd that makes apps for others on demand, for profit.

                    Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, garbage collection jank, and deoptimizations can slow your app down. Chrome‚Äôs JavaScript engine, V8, ships with its own profiling tools that can identify such problems. We‚Äôll dive deep into the inner workings of V8 to better understand what these terms mean - and how to avoid them. You‚Äôll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several V8 developer tools.

                Node.js is growing up, and with that comes the responsibility of delivering proper legacy support. From Node.js Argon (v4.2.0) onwards, there is an official Long Term Support release cycle that lasts for 30 months. How does a project moving at the pace of Node maintain multiple release lines? How does a commit get backported? How is a release actually made? You will learn all this and more in this talk.

                  The web has disrupted the way developer approach software development. It is Fast, almost FTL. It‚Äôs not rare to hear people saying they want their own project to scale like the web, and to evolve as fast as the web. But how does it evolves so fast without being (too) chaotic? The W3C, short for world wide web consortium, is the body in charge of defining the web, the JavaScript APIs that all applications (wether browser or framework rendering web pages) should support to be web-compliant. That process is not well know to web developers which is a pity as their feedback is THE MOST important thing in the evolution of the web.
                  Two W3C Invited Experts will provide insights into the W3C. What is the process through which the web evolve? What are the advantages you, as web developers, could have by following the process, or even becoming an active member? How to make a difference? What is the difference in terms of evolution between the web and the internet? Both will provide feedback from their respective point of view, and will answer questions from the audience.
